          Implementation of Catan and Development of an Artificial Intelligence
          Agent for the Tabletop Games Framework
        </h1>
        <p>
          For my final year project at QMUL I was fortunate to have the
          opportunity to work on the Tabletop Games Framework alongside a cohort
          of world-leading researchers and PhD students. I worked on the
          development of the classic board game Settlers Of Catan (Klaus Teuber,
          2008) and was responsible for the implementation of several core
          features such as trading. Our implementation of Catan then served as a platform for
          conducting research into the abilities of various different AI agents. My findings are documented in this
          <a href="assets/final-year-project.pdf">report</a>.
